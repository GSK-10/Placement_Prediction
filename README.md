# Placement_Prediction
Machine Learning course-based project (CBP) made using Python | Numpy | Pandas | Sklearn | Tensorflow | Streamlit

## Basic Setup
- Place the Jupyter Notebook and Datasets in the same folder
- Change the path links of the dataset in the 'read-method' appropriately

## Installation
(!pip install <package_name> | tyoe one command in each cell)

```
# Basic
!pip install scikit-learn
!pip install pandas
!pip install numpy
!pip install matplotlib
!pip install seaborn

# Other:
pip install tensorflow
pip install torch
pip install torchvision

# For Interface
!pip install streamlit
(
    type "streamlit hello" to check for streamlit intsall in the terminal
     - Go to --> Anaconda Navigator --> Environments --> Terminal
     - change path to your working directory
     - type > streamlit hello
)
```

## Instructions to run
1) Open jupyter niotebook and run the College_Placement_Prediction.ipynb file.
2) After running, check if 'knn_model.pkl' or other .pkl files are in the /Downloads section or your working directory
  - (if not present check its path)
3) Go to --> Anaconda Navigator --> Environments --> Terminal
Change the path to /Downloads or your working directory.
4) Run 'streamlit run cbp_web.py' command.
